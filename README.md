## Introduction
This app was created based off the following savings plan steps:
1. Set a savings range, currently set to a savings range of $1 to $100. (Capability to manipulate this is a future iteration.)
2. Each day that you work, draw a random number from the savings range. This number is the amount of money you will set aside into your savings. This number is then removed from the drawing possibilities until the savings range is completed.
3. Repeat drawing until you have drawn all numbers.
4. Once you have drawn all numbers in the savings range, the summation of the savings range will be the total you have contributed to your savings e.g. with a savings range of $1 to $100, the summation will total $5050!

The app is not connected to your bank account so it is currently up to the user to actually set aside or transfer any money into their savings.
